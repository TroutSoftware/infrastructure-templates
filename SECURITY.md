## Reporting a Vulnerability

The repository provides *examples* of configuration only, and Trout Software decline liability for damages resulting of use of the templates.

We do strive to maintain high security standards in our templates, especially:

 - configuration provided follows good practices of the underlying platform
 - using the templates, as provided, is safe against attacks such as arbitrary code injection

Most issues should be dealt with by creating a report in https://github.com/TroutSoftware/infrastructure-templates/issues/new.

If you feel you found an issue that cannot be responsibly discussed in the open, please report a vulnerability at https://forms.gle/zQcz8kE6PwD1iPFTA.

NB: In line with our general disclosure policy, we do not generally accept submission for bounties.
